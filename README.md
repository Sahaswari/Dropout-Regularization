# Dropout-Regularization
You can learn, why we use dropout and what are the changes to code from it.

No point of view High accuracy in tran data set than test data set. It may happen overfitting when increasing the number of epochs. It can not give good accuracy for the test data. Then can use that dropout regularization for that.
